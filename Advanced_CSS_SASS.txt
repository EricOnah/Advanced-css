A crash course for CSS and SASS. (Based on a project)

Basic Starter CSS setup: This will reset the default browser setting of your page onload

* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

// This will reset the default browser setting for margin and padding
//For box-sizing: border-box; This means the paddings and margins will not be 
added to the defined size of the box element


body {
    font-family:"Lato", sans-serif; ;
    font-weight: 400;
    line-height: 1.7;
    padding: 30px;
    color: #777;
}

//The above sets your preferred style for the body element which is inherited by all the child elements if no 
other style is defined for the element. NOTE: Padding is not inherited by all the child elements.


Building the header:

.header {
    height: 95vh;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, 
    rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8), 
    rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)),
    url(../img/bg.jpg);
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: top;

    clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75%, 0 100%)
}

//The above defines the style of the header. Without a defined width, it assumes the width of the container.
//Tha background image features a color gradient overlayed on the background image.
//With background-size set to cover, the image adjust without losing pixels to fit the container.
//background-position: top; The image is adjusted to show more of the top side of the image.
//The clip-path property is used to clip images in a specific way. 
//The polygonn we use has four sides(x y, x y, x y, x y) The x and y represents axis. So we set the starting point of the polygon
//to 0 0(no movement), te next side in a clockwise direction we set the x to 100% because we need the image to
//go 100% in the x direction from the starting point to the second side of the polygon and y to zero.
//for the 3rd side we set the x to 100% as well and the y to 75% because we want the image to be clip at this point.
//the 4th side the x is set to zero and the y to 100% from origin.
