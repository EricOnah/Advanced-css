h1A crash course for CSS and SASS. (Based on a project)

Basic Starter CSS setup: This will reset the default browser setting of your page onload

    * {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        box-sizing: border-box;
    }

// This will reset the default browser setting for margin and padding
//For box-sizing: border-box; This means the paddings and margins will not be 
added to the defined size of the box element


    body {
        font-family:"Lato", sans-serif; ;
        font-weight: 400;
        line-height: 1.7;
        padding: 30px;
        color: #777;
    }

//The above sets your preferred style for the body element which is inherited by all the child elements if no 
other style is defined for the element. NOTE: Padding is not inherited by all the child elements.


Building the header:

    .header {
        height: 95vh;
        background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, 
        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8), 
        rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)),
        url(../img/bg.jpg);
        background-size: cover;
        background-position: top;

        clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75%, 0 100%);
        position: relative;
    }

//The above defines the style of the header. Without a defined width, it assumes the width of the container.
//Tha background image features a color gradient overlayed on the background image.
//With background-size set to cover, the image adjust without losing pixels to fit the container.
//background-position: top; The image is adjusted to show more of the top side of the image.
//The clip-path property is used to clip images in a specific way. 
//The polygon we use has four sides(x y, x y, x y, x y) The x and y represents axis. So we set the starting point of the polygon
//to 0 0(no movement), te next side in a clockwise direction we set the x to 100% because we need the image to
//go 100% in the x direction from the starting point to the second side of the polygon and y to zero.
//for the 3rd side we set the x to 100% as well and the y to 75% because we want the image to be clip at this point.
//the 4th side the x is set to zero and the y to 100% from origin.

hmtl structure for the logo: Since image is an inline element, it's better to wrap the img with a div.

    <div class="logo-box">
        <img src="#" alt="logo" class="logo">
    </div>

//This will make the styling easy.

styling The logo:

position: To use this the parent element of the box should have it's position relative so tha the positions
defined for the box will be in relation to the parent element.

With the logo-box we set the position of the logo in the header and with class logo, we define the size of the logo.

    .logo-box {
        position: absolute;
        top: 40px;
        left: 40px;
    }

    .logo {
        height: 35px;
    }

//You can always play with these numbers

Heading: For SEO pupose, the h1 is the most important heading. So it is used to define the heading of the web page.
for this project, we split the heading into two using a span element for styling purposes.
    <div class="text-box">
        <h1 class="heading-primary>
            <span class="heading-primary-main">The main title</span>
            <span class="heading-primary-sub">The sub-main title</span>
        </h1>
    </div>
   

Styling the heading: The heading-primary class will style the whole heading while the span classes will style the
individual parts of the heading.

    .heading-primary {
        color: #;
        text-transform: uppercase;
    }

To have the individual parts of the heading occupying separate line we give the display property block.

    .heading-primary-main {
        display: block;
        font-size: ;
        font-weight: ;
        letter-spacing: ;
    }

    .heading-primary-sub {
        display: block;
        font-size: ;
        font-weight: ;
        letter-spacing: ;
    }

To position the heading in the center, we style the text-box.

    .text-box {
        position: absolute;
        top: 50%;
        left: 50%;
        transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
    }

The above style in the text-box is how to center an element in the parent container using positioning.

//We styled the box after styling the heading text but the box style should be put above the heading style to follow
//the html order.

NOTE: Always wrap parts of a section to be styled separately in a div.

Adding animation to the heading text: Using @keyframes we can add animation to a css element.

    @keyframes moveInLeft {
        0% {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateX(-100px);
        }

        80% {
            transform: translateX(20px); 
        }

        100% {
           opacity: 1;
            transform: translateX(0); 
        }
    }

We define the % to be a point in the animation time. You can whatever point from 0 - 100. To apply this animation to a css element
we add the animation property to it's styling. animation: <animation name> <animation duration> <animation timing fxn>
Since we are animating the heading text we add this animation property to the heading text.

NOTE: Browser is optmized for opacity and transform property.
NOTE: The 80% point is added for bouncing effect. The over moves at 80% and returns to 0 at 100%.

    .heading-primary-main {
        display: block;
        font-size: ;
        font-weight: ;
        letter-spacing: ;
        animation: moveInLeft .2s ease-in;
    } 

For the sub heading we can dd a moveInRight animation to show a movement in the opposite direction.
to do this, we define properties that are exact opposite to the the moveInLeft animation.


    .heading-primary-sub {
            display: block;
            font-size: ;
            font-weight: ;
            letter-spacing: ;
            animation: moveInRight .2s ease-out;
            
        }

//to fix the shake in the animation we use a property backface-visibility and set it to hidden. This is added
the heading itself

      .heading-primary {
        color: #;
        text-transform: uppercase;
        backface-visibility: hidden;
    }
